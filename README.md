# Commerce

## Goals

Commerce is a Minecraft mod. Its goals are to:

* Have painless adoption by being entirely server-side.
* Compliment vanilla Minecraft's gameplay by augmentations, not additions.
* Encourage small communities and commerce by creating scarcity and dependence.
* Focus on hardcore multiplayer survival and short server sessions (about a week to a month).

## The Mod

Commerce is entirely server side. What this means is that any vanilla client can participate in a Commerce server. However, to run the server you will need Forge, which you can download [here]().

This mod does not aim to be compatible with other mods, especially if they have their own additions. This mod's primary focus is augmenting the Minecraft experience.

## Augmentations

One of the main goals is to make small, subtle changes with big impact on gameplay. Commerce focuses on using existing systems, just modified slightly. There are a couple exceptions, this biggest is the concept of Knowledge Points and Competencies.

## Scarcity

Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics. Without something being scarce, it can't have value. Scarcity can be contextual. For example, air on earth is free because of it's abundance, but for a colony on mars, or a toxic city, it could be worth something. In vanilla Minecraft, scarcity is rare; everyone can just go and get the item they desire with relative ease. A symptom of this is the usefulness of villagers is underutilized.

Commerce creates scarcity by gating what players can do behind *Competencies*. Everyone starts out with X Knowledge Points, or KP, which they can use to purchase. To compliment Minecraft's core progression through the attainment of items, there is not progression for Competencies, or way to gain KP. You can purchase competencies at the start of the game. All decisions are permanent though, so it might be wise to be a bit flexible in the beginning.

There are some things that every player can do, the "Core" competencies:

Can place all objects (redstone & seeds are an exception and requires certain skills).
Can consume potions.
Can interract with chests, shulker boxes, books, lecturns, etc.
Can use basic laborer stuff: buckets, sheers, clock, flint & steel.

### Competencies

Competencies can be broken up into two categories: labor and craft. The distinction doesn't matter in game, but it's good to keep in mind where you're specializing. Too much emphasis on one category will make you more dependent, but it could also help if there is a community shortage.
