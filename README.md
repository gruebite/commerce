# Commerce

## Goals

Commerce is a Minecraft mod. Its goals are to:

* Have painless adoption by being entirely server-side.
* Compliment vanilla Minecraft's gameplay by augmentations, not additions.
* Encourage small communities and commerce by creating scarcity and dependence.
* Focus on hardcore multiplayer survival and short server sessions (about a week to a month).

## The Mod

Commerce is entirely server side. What this means is that any vanilla client can participate in a Commerce server. However, to run the server you will need Forge, which you can download [here]().

This mod does not aim to be compatible with other mods, especially if they have their own additions. This mod's primary focus is augmenting the vanilla Minecraft experience.

## Augmentations

One of the main goals is to make small, subtle changes with big impact on gameplay. Commerce focuses on using existing systems, modified slightly. There are a couple exceptions, the biggest are the concept of Knowledge Points and Competencies.

## Scarcity

Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics. Without something being scarce, it can't have value. Scarcity is contextual. For example, air on earth is free because of its abundance, but for a colony on mars, or a toxic city, it has value. In vanilla Minecraft, there is little scarcity; everyone can just go and get the item they desire with relative ease. A symptom of this is trading and villager utilization is neglected.

Commerce creates scarcity by gating what players can do behind *Competencies*. Everyone starts out with X Knowledge Points, or KP, which they can use to purchase Competencies. To compliment Minecraft's core progression through the attainment of items, there is no progression for Competencies, or way to gain KP. You can purchase competencies at the start of the game. All decisions are permanent though, so it might be wise to be flexible in the beginning.

There are some things that every player can do, the "Core" competencies:

* Can place all objects (redstone & seeds are an exception and requires certain skills).
* Can consume potions.
* Can interract with chests, shulker boxes, books, lecturns, etc.
* Can use basic laborer stuff: buckets, sheers, clock, flint & steel.

* All wooden planks
* Crafting table
* Scaffolding
* Torch
* Blue ice, packed ice, snow
* Prismarine
* Campfire
* Turtle helmet
* All blocks
* All bricks
* Coarse dirt
* Jack o lantern


### Competencies

This is the list of competencies and what they do and craft. Below are some common items and the competencies you need to attain them:

* Iron weapon/tool: carpentry (wood pickaxe) -> mining (stone) -> masonry (stone pickaxe) -> mining (iron ore) -> smelting (iron bar) -> metalsmithing
* Potion: excavating (sand) -> smelting (glass) -> glassblowing (bottle) -> alchemy
* Enchanted item (not including item): cartography (paper) -> tailoring (book) -> carpentry (bookshelve) -> engineering (enchanting table) -> enchanter

Since a single player will not have all of these competencies at the same time, the ceiling is much lower for lone wolf characters and they would probably be more combat focused and steal what they need.

Players start with 18KP by default (configurable), which limits them to about 1-2 major competencies, and a few minor ones. This can be adjusted based on the excpected server size, but shouldn't go below 12. The total KP required (at the time of writing) to acquire every competency is 127. Use this as a guide for community size. 18 would allow full coverage with ~7 people. However some competencies you would likely want a lot of overlap especially in free-for-all servers, like swordfighting, so you can supply an army.
